# Audio Authencity Checker
Welcome to the Audio Authenticity Checker repository! This project demonstrates our effort in developing a machine learning model that determines whether an audio file is real or fake.

About the Project

This project was created collaboratively by three friends passionate about machine learning and audio processing. The goal of this project is to tackle challenges in identifying fake audio, which could be generated through deepfake audio tools.
